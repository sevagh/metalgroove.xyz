# What makes Metal Groove?

I'm [Sevag](https://github.com/sevagh), and for many years I've been obsessed with metal, the genre of music. The best part about metal is the moments of unanimous consensus on a groove: when the entire crowd devolves into a wall of death, when you just cannot help but be compelled to motion by something larger than just the beat or time signature, but this almost immeasurable quality called _groove_.

Throughout the program of my [Master of Arts in Music Technology](https://sevag.xyz/academic), I explored different aspects of this obsession:

* Could I write code that could predict headbangs that agreed with my own instinct?
* What measures of audio analysis corresponded to headbanging?
* What are the different aspects of rhythm, beats, and tempo, and how can I create useful tooling based on what exist in the world?

## Auditory consensus beat tracking

(headbang.py)

## Pose estimation and analysis of human motion

(headbang.py)

## Polyrhythms, a fancy metronome, and a drum track generator

(libmetro, drum_machine)

## Animation driven by beat and tempo

(electropartyogram, btrack)

## Source separation and transient shapers

umx.cpp, demucs.cpp, zen, realtime-hpss, multi-band transient shaper
